The primary aim of inclusive education model is to enable children with autism to have education with children without any mental inability. Inclusion-based education is significant to children with autism. This education model ensures communication and its continuity that children with autism have with the outside world. Through inclusion, they achieve a life in which they are individuals and have accomplished various challenges.

For a children with autism to get inclusive education, he or she must comply with some criteria. Factors such as IQ score, autism severity and communication level affect if the child is suitable for the inclusive education or not. In inclusion programs, parents accompany their children while they are with various special education teachers and classroom teachers. Parents role in inclusion programs are fundamental. Out-of-school performance also bears significant information on the education of a child with autism. The inclusive education is carried out not only in school, but also in homes too, where parents take up the role of educators in education of their children. The more the parents are involved in the education process, the higher the success of the child both in and out of school.

There are many requirements for a successful inclusive education. First of these is to give detailed information to the children, who do not have autism and will be personally interacting with the children with autism. It is harder for children than adults to accept individuals among them that are different from themselves. Making children understand the existence of an individual with autism among them, providing an environment where they can be friendly to each other with this awareness is important.

Another importance of inclusion to a child with autism is the increase in ability to learn by watching peers. Children with autism, who spend time with their peers, can generally learn useful skills from children without autism.

###Practices for Successful Inclusion###

The most simple and effective way to give a successful inclusive education is to fulfill necessary services. When provided with an educated tutor, a cultivated parent interaction and a physically healthy environment; a child with autism can easily receive necessary inclusive education.

Before moving forward with the inclusive education, inclusion student with autism should be provided with a training. To ensure the general participation in the class, first of all, child with autism should receive maximum knowledge and education level. This way while education the child receives will continue seamlessly, the process of adaptation to new friends will also accelerate.

For new inclusion student to not feel alienated, one of the parent should accompany the child. Other than that, the student should be made comfortable by being familiarized with the areas he might frequently use, such as toilet, corridors, yard and common areas, on the days when he does not have his parents with him. The child then will be able to take the first step to being an individual and go on with his educational life without feeling bad or fearing getting abandoned when he is not accompanied by his parents.

Parents of other children in the class also take an important part in determining the attitude of their kids towards the inclusion students. When these parents approach to inclusion students, they will, in a way, be role models to their well-informed children, who in return will realize the situation and behave accordingly.

Another crucial effect of inclusive education on children with autism is that they can gain experience on how to live in a society after school. Children with autism can get job opportunities after school, and they will pay attention to applying social norms they have learned in school. Individuals with autism who received accurate and effective inclusive education can adapt to life more easily and sustain a more comfortable life.
