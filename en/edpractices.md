# Educational Practices for Autism

Education is an important factor in recovery and integration process of children with autism. It is essential to practice education in sync with therapy and treatment. Education plays a great role in solving problems relating to learning, comprehending and making sense, and having children practice towards these. A specially prepared education program is practiced with children with autism.

Autism education is separated into various steps. Firstly, a profile of the child, who will receive the education, needs to be created. While some children may receive education with their peers with autism, others need one-on-one education. Also, the process of preparing for the education must always be one-on-one. Main purpose of education is to reinforce the skills that were gained through therapy and help children be able to achieve information and practice by themselves.

### Education in Family

Families, first of all, should find activities their children are interested in and encourage them. Only in this case children can obtain abilities. It will be possible to upskill the child with 3 or 5 minute activities 2-3 times a day. Also, the environments of education should be cleared of any material or toy that would distract the child. With that, change of environment may cause children with autism to react negatively. Thus, it would be beneficial to give skill educations in the same environments. If there is a necessity for a change, you must make sure that the child is familiarized and feels safe in this new environment.

## Educational Practices

Education for children with autism is provided by Ministry of National Education and private institutions. With this education, children are taught and gain various skills. Children then join inclusion programs and thus be with their peers, interacting with the environment. With that, there are different educational programs for children with autism. Which program to go with is generally decided after running some tests and creating a profile with the data.

### Applied Behavior Analysis

First step of education in autism is applied behavior analysis (ABA). The goal of this program is to analyze child&#39;s behavior and environmental features of this behavior, and then create the program for education. Although many people think this is a reward-punishment method, the program has a different mechanism. Behavior analysis is designed to eliminate negative behavior that prevent the child from learning and developing skills. Positive behavior is rewarded, whereas negative ones are corrected by the instructor. Here, the aim is to remove negative behavior and educate the child with this treatment, which lasts 20-40 hours a week.

### Education with Activity Charts

This method is used for gaining skills. The aim is to help the child gain certain skills by splitting them into small pieces. Skills are cut and made into smaller activities. The child with autism gains the skill by fulfilling these activities. It is safe to say that this method generally brings about positive outcomes. It is especially efficient since children are not dependent on other people to develop their skills. Also, it helps them to think in detail and extensively. Today, the method is used in many educational institutions.

### Modeling Method

Every child, with or without Autism Spectrum Disorder, needs a role model through their learning process. Children learn basic motor skills, like speaking, thanks to their role model. It should be noted that this have more importance for children with autism. Using modeling method, it is easier for them to learn various skills. In modeling education practice, generally videos are utilized as materials. The child is asked to follow the person in the video and do the same thing the person is doing. This way it is possible to put skill-learning into practice.

In video modeling method, the child has access to material that would help him to learn. For example, while the video about using items is displayed, the child is asked to move the items and use them just as the role model in the video is using them. Through this, the child is able to put the skills he is taught into practice. In some cases, the child is recorded while performing some behaviors and then this way, he can learn by watching his own behavior.

### Incidental Teaching

This program essentially aims to enhance communication skills of children. First, an environment is created that enables the child to attempt communication. To give an example, a toy or an item that might attract the child is put somewhere he can reach. To reach it, child is asked to initiate a communication or indicate this will with mimics, gesture or verbal communication methods. When the child attempts to communicate, the toy is put wherever he wants it to be. Communication skills can be enhanced by repeating this throughout the day. This method is accepted as an efficient way to engage the children. It is scientifically proven that children who received incidental teaching enhance their communication abilities.

### Functional Evaluation and Analysis

Functional evaluation falls under both educational and therapy method categories. The purpose of it is to detect the reasons of negative behavior of children with autism and help them gain positive behavior against the same reasons and factors. Temper tantrum of individuals with autism is generally for their emotional gratification. In functional evaluation method, a rewarding system is built for newly formed behavior and thus, children can be pleased with the new behavior they performed.

### Social Stories

This method was first started to be used in 1991 by educator Carol Gray. It is practiced through written stories for literate children, and stories with picture for illiterate ones. The goal here is to tell children what they need to do through specially prepared stories. This method is an effective way to gain especially social skills.

Purpose of the stories is to explain &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot; questions. Since children with autism have problems with contemplating and sense-making, it might be difficult for them to understand the purposes of their acts. Stories are devised to eliminate these problems. It helps children gain social skills by having them create cause and effect relation.
