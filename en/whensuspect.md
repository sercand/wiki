# When to Suspect Autism?

In US, just like around the world, there have been many awareness campaigns started to be organized and many families were informed by these campaigns. Autism is a developmental disorder that generally occurs in the first three years of life. Individuals with autism struggle with social communication. Many communication types, including verbal and non-verbal, can be included in these social interactions. Repetitive behavior and limited fields of interest are also observed in individuals with autism.

### Autism is a Lifelong Genetic Disorder

Thanks to developments in technologies, autism can be diagnosed when children are eighteen months old. However, age three is ideal for a certain diagnosis. Of course parents&#39; observation of their children are important in this matter. Some indications should definitely be observed to understand if an individual suffers from autism or not.

To state an individual has autism definitely does not mean that individual is &quot;sick&quot;. Since it is necessary to give special attention to people who are born with some special conditions, it is important to detect autism in individuals who have it. Main object in diagnosing the autism is to provide individual with an environment that would increase their quality of life.

### There Are some Symptoms to Observe in Social Communication Disorder

Behaviors of a child, who is predicted to have autism, should first be observed during social communication while growing. To suspect autism, different disorders should be detected during social interactions. Avoiding eye contact may be the most significant one, to give an example. Facial expressions, posture and mimics may also give parents an idea.

The child is falling behind on his peers and having issues in relations with peers while growing up may be considered as a disorder.

Children with autism are not enthusiastic about sharing what they enjoy doing with others.

Not being active in social situations, staying behind on emotional interaction or not being able to respond are also among the symptoms of social communication disorder.

### Communication Disorder Symptom Must Be Determined

Lack of language development is an important indication. Aside from that, it is also accepted as an indication if the child has started to talk but takes too long to develop in spoken language. It may be seen as an autism sign if the child is not making an effort on completing what he could not verbalize with his gestures.

There may be a difficulty in starting a dialogue with other children that developed in language. The situation is also needed to be evaluated if the child is having issues in maintaining the conversation that started.

Speeches of children with autism may repeat. Sometimes they may create their own language and speak very subjectively. They communicate using stereotype language.

### Symptom in Imaginative or Symbolic Play

Children may play various games depending on their development level. Generally, they play social games by using what they see from the adults with the help of their imagination. Children with autism fall behind on playing these imaginative games.

Constantly repeating certain acts and not willing to go out of certain activities may also be considered as symptoms. Their field of interest is limited to a little environment. They can repeat the same move for hours and it would be hard to get their attention in the meantime. Children with autism focus intensively on the limited activity they are interested, while it is pretty easy to change focus of a normal individual.

Even without a motive, they keep repeating certain moves. When interfered, they may become restless or react.

If you observe many of the above, you should seek help from a specialist. Brains of individuals with autism work differently than the brains of individuals that we consider normal. All we have to do is to learn how to treat these special brains and create a livable world for them.
