# Determining Emotional Needs of a Child with Autism and the Parents

Parents are important for development of every child. Children become self-confident and sturdy individuals when they feel the support of their family until adolescence and be a part of the society. This applies to children with special needs, such as autism. Children with autism who get support from their families in terms of emotion, become outgoing and are reintroduced to the society in a loving way.

### Emotional Needs of Parents of a Child with Autism

Parents, also, need emotional support. They may behave depressively as they feel insufficient because of their child&#39;s situation. With this, a need for professional hep may arise. In this way, this vain mood will be left behind and all support that the autistic child needs will be provided by the parents.

According to studies, 27% of the parents who have a child with autism refrain from visiting their neighbors or going out. This shows that every 1 of 4 children with autism are kept away from social interactions with their parents. In another words, since parents worry that their kids might create a &quot;scene&quot;, they abstain from including their children into their social environment. This behavior might result in spending less time with the child or breaking ties with their own social environment. If parents don&#39;t spend enough time with their child, there will be a serious impairment in behavior of the child. If any system has been set up until that period, it would break and personal development of the child would eventually stop. In the other way around, parents become distant with their social environments, leading to feeling insufficient and unhappy that may result in stress and depression.

Parents of a child with autism should devote as much time for themselves as they do for their child and fulfill their needs too. Activities they participate in with their child would be an excellent exercise for their child to adapt to the society. One of the best ways to teach the rules is for children to practice them.

Parents play a huge role in determining the emotional needs of a child with autism. Children usually spend a lot of time with their parents. They get every piece of information they learned and will learn, from their parents. After accepting stage has passed, parents should learn to be patient with their kids. They should be aware of their child&#39;s special condition and make wise decisions for them. Priority for a child with autism is love. They should feel as a part of the family they are in and parents should be patient and loving with them. Children with autism, just like other children, imitate their role models in early ages. Generally these role models are family members. Children, who developed themselves by observing their family members, will also continue this learning process in later ages and thus be able to separate the good from the bad.
